I am currently a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Ying Wei](https://wei-ying.net/), [Prof. Linqi Song](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/), and [Prof. Chen Ma](https://allenjack.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), where I supervised by [Prof. Jin Liu](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2952.htm) on topics related to Knowledge Graphs and Link Prediction.

Currently, my research focuses on LLM-based machine translation (MT) and addressing its key challenges, such as hallucinations. My work aims to deeply investigate how and why LLM-based MT systems generate errors, both from a linguistic perspective and through interpretability frameworks.
